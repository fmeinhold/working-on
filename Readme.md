# Working-On

## What it is

First and foremost it's useful to me - it's a tool to easly track my time with toggl track from the command line,
using different sources as tasks. At the moment working-on only supports toggl and jira as sources, but this might 
change in the future. It is also an excuse to learn go.

It has only been tested on MacOS and Linux so far.

## Install

Coming Soon, looking into homebrew taps.


## Setup

Run ```wo init```- this will ask you for your toggl track api key (https://track.toggl.com/profile) and some other, 
mostly date and time related questions. After that, you can find the config in ~/.config/working-on/config.yaml.
